## Class and Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object. <br />
- A class is a blueprint for an object.
- An object is always an instance of a class. One class can have many instances.
- Use the `__init__()` function to assign values to object properties. The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
- The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, used to access variables that belongs to the class; it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class.
- When we call a method on an object, Python automatically fills in the first variable, which we call self by convention. This first variable is a reference to the object itself, hence it’s name. We can use this variable to reference other instance variables and functions of this object, like `self.firstname` and `self.greetings()`.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, firstname, lastname, age):
        self.firstname = firstname
        self.lastname = lastname
        self.age = age
   
    def greetings(self):
        print("hello, " + self.firstname + self.lastname)

# constructs and initializes the object p1
p1 = Person("Butter", "Fly", 2)
p1.greetings()

>>> "hello, ButterFly"
```

## Method
When a function is part of an object, ie. `greetings()`

## Inheritance
DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself.

Inheritance is bascially a class of class, allowing us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
- Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
- Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
- When you add the `__init__()` function, the child class no longer inherits the parent's `__init__()`, unless:

```python
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)

p2 = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
p2.greetings()
```

## Super_Init
When you override the constructor, the constructor from the parent class (from which we inherited) is not called at all. To make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
- You need the `super()` function, so you do not have to use the name of the parent element.
- `super()` returns a reference to the parent class, so we can call the constructor of the parent class.

```python
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

p3 = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
p3.greetings()


# Add Properties
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = 2019

p4 = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
p4.graduationyear


# or
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

p5 = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2020)
p5.graduationyear


# Add New Methods in Child Class:
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)

p6 = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2020)
p6.welcome()
```
