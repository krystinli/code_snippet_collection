## Python Class and Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

### 01_Creation
```python
# Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5

# Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x) # return 5
```
