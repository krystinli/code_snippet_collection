## python_packages

python-wheels
- Wheels make the end-to-end installation of Python packages faster for two reasons:
  - wheels are smaller in size than source distributions, meaning they can move faster across a network.
  - Installing from wheels directly avoids the intermediate step of building packages off of the source distribution.

pyproject-toml
- PEP - stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.
- A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment.
