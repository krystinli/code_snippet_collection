### variable_assignment
- When assigning a variable in Python, you're creating a **reference to the object**.
- Assignment is referred to as **binding**, as we are binding a name to an object.
```py
# a and b now actually refers to the same object. Updating either a or b updates both of them:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
```
